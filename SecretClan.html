<p> SecretClan was the sixth Clan created chronologically, after the Forest Clans and VibeClan. <p>
<p>The cats in SecretClan live in the area in front of Highstones, and eat mice and occaisionally rabbits. They were not named after a cat, but instead after their secrecy. Each cat has a second life due to being so close to the Moonstone, and, by extension, StarClan.</p>
