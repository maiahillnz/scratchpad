<h1>SecretClan</h1>

<p> SecretClan was the sixth Clan created chronologically, after the Forest Clans and VibeClan. <p>
<p>The cats in SecretClan live in the area in front of Highstones, and eat mice and occaisionally rabbits. They were not named after a cat, but instead after their secrecy. Each cat has a second life due to being so close to the Moonstone, and, by extension, StarClan.</p>
<p>Their founder, Treestar, named them after their secrecy, and partly their first medicine cat's name.</p>


<h2> General Personality</h2>

<p>SecretClan cats are usually quiet, caring, and very independent. They are fiercely loyal to one another, but if a cat betrays them, then the cats can change from kind to hostile quicker than a wildfire spreads.</p>
<p>They are humorous at times.</p>
<p>They are helpful to the other Clans, and hate it when they are attacked by outside cats, such as rogues.</p>
